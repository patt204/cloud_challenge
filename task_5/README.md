TASK 5
You will now learn how to create Cloud SQL instance.

Step 1
Go go GCP Console and find Cloud SQL.

Step 2
We will now customise the instance. Choose Connections

Step 3Ô∏è
Click on your instance, under the General you will be presented with information about how to connect to the instance. You will need the Public IP Address . So copy that address.

Step 4

Open Dbeaver, on the left hand side in the white space use right click to and then choose Create New Folder

Step 5
Click Advanced options. And then Networking. Add a network tag dareit-public . This tag will be used to match firewall rules to the instances to which the rules should apply.

Step 6
So what now?
1. Add one more column to the students table called age with type int
2. Add 5 more rows to the table with some proper data. So information about 5 more students.
3. Prepare a query that will answer the question what is average age of the students in the class?
My answer: 29.5
4. Extract to txt data from the students table.
5. Create a new folder in your cloud_challenge repo with name task_5 , commit the txt file there. Add a readme.md with the answer to question from point 3.
