TASK 8

Tech Challenge

This is a challenge where you can showcase your technical skills. Your solution may be as simple or complex as you like as long as it meets the requirements below.

The Brief

You have been asked to create a website. As a proof of concept, it will be sufficient that you demonstrate a website that displays text (e.g. Lorem Ipsum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) and an image on a single home page.
You can create your own application but can also use open-source or community software, such as WordPress (https://wordpress.org).
You can use one of the below depending on the complexity of the solution you want to create:
static website in GCS
single VM
AppEngine
two VMs behind a Load Balancer
Kubernetes cluster (GKE)
This proof of concept is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of hosting, managing, and scaling the platform and is not about content.

Requirements:

Deliver the tooling to set up an application that displays a web page with Lorem Ipsum text and an image
Provide source code for creating the stack in a publicly available repository e.g. Github (https://github.com)
Provide basic setup documentation to run the application
All resources should be deployed using Terraform
Automate the deployment of your application using CI/CD
