# DareIT - cloud_challenge
# 2. Static website

1. Knowledge Base (GCS - Google Cloud Storage, IAM - Identity and Management, The GCP resource hierarchy has four levels: organization, folder, project, and resource).
2. IAM deep dive.
3. Installing Cloud SDK.

TASK 2 
The goal of the task is to host a static website in a GCS bucket. You won’t be able to interact with the website, but it will display some content configured by you.

Step 1
Go to console.cloud.google.com. On the Navigation Menu choose Cloud Storage. Create a bucket.

Step 2
Create in your cloud_challenge repository folder called task_2. In that folder create two files:
first file called website_url
second file called index.html

Step 3️
Upload the index.html file to the bucket. You can drag and drop that file in the browser.

Step 4
Amend permissions of the bucket. If we want the website to be accessible by others we need to change the permissions.

Step 5
Copy the public url of the object and paste it into your browser (you can use incognito tab or your phone to access it).
